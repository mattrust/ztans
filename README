The Tangram is a chinese puzzle. The object is to put seven geometric 
shapes together so as to form a given outline. All the pieces must be 
used and are laid next to one another. The pieces are five triangles, a 
square and a parallelogram. Sometimes there is more than one solution. 
They're all accepted as long as they have the same outline.

gTans features:

    * Hundreds of figures.
    * Help and solution.
    * Most of the game colors and textures are configurable.
    * Native Language Support via GNU gettext.
    * Resizeable window.
    * The size of the pieces (relative to the game area) may be changed.
    * The solved figures are remembered. 

Beginning with 1.99.0, gTans requires GTK+ 2.6.0 or later.  When building
from source, besides the GTK2 development packages (debian: libgtk2.0-dev),
pkg-config and intltool (>=0.40.5) are required.  If building from SVN,
rsvg-convert (debian: librsvg2-bin) is also required to build the icons.
