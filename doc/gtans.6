.SH NAME
gtans \- Tangram game for X
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gtans
.I "[no options]"
.br
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Gtans is a tangram game that runs in X. Tangram is a kind of puzzle game where the player has to arrange a set of pieces to match a given shape.


.SH OPTIONS
	No command-line options
.br 
	Use the graphical interface to customize the program. See below.

.SH USAGE
.PP	The rules of the game are simple:
move the pieces (known as tans) until they match
the figure drawn on the right window.
You must always use the seven tans and they should not
be laid on top of one another.

To move a tan, click and drag it with left mouse button,
for rotation click AROUND it.
You can flip the selected tan by right-clicking. This
is usefull for the parallelogram tan (all positions
can not be reached by rotating only).

If you are a beginner to Tangram you should try the first 10 figures.
The other ones are not sorted, some of them are very difficult (to my
taste).

When a figure has been solved the background color of the silhouette
area changes. The solved figures are remembered by saving a status
file in the user's directory (~/.gtans/afile.figures.status for a
figure file called afile.figures)

.B Show a tan
This button shows the position of a tan. Each further click will display
an other tan.

.B Show outline
Draw the figure in the main area. This makes the game much easier.

.B Preferences
Most of this menu's options allow you to change the colors used by the
game. For the main area you may choose textures (pixmap files) instead
of colors. Some sample files are supplied (I can't remember where I
found them) but as the complete pathname is saved in the config file
you can choose a file located anywhere (for example in
/usr/share/pixmaps/). On a 8 bits display the colors may not be
exactly what you want (GTK tries to find the best matching color).

.B Preferences/Tans size/Increase
Makes the tans 5 % bigger relatively to the game area. If you resize
the window the tans size will be scaled.

.B Preferences/Tans size/Decrease
Makes the tans 4.76 % smaller

.B Preferences/Accuracy
Changes the precision of the comparison between the tans position and
the solution. A lower accuracy makes the game more easy.

.B Preferences/Rotation
Step by step allows only rotation by increment of 11.5 degrees.
Continuous rotation makes the game more difficult and you probably
shouldn't use it unless you really dislike step by step rotation.

.B Preferences/Figures file
Allows you to choose another figures file.

.B Preferences/Save config
Save a config file in the user's home directory.

.B Misc/Clear figure status
Set the current figure as unsolved.

.B Misc/Clear all figures status
Set all the loaded figures (i.e. from the current figure file) as
unsolved.

.SH FILES
