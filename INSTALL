install
-=-=-=-

delete the old version (see below)

unarchive the file and go to gTans directory :

> gunzip gtans.tar.gz
> tar xvf gtans.tar
> cd gtans-1.2


(optionnally) edit the makefile. You may also edit po/Makefile
and misc/Makefile, for example for Solaris you should change
share/locale to lib/locale.


Compile the program (and build the NLS catalogs):

> make

Copy the program to /usr/bin/ ,
other files to /usr/share/gtans/ ,
create a default config file
(and install the catalogs) :

> su
> make install
> exit


Uninstall
-=-=-=-=-

>su
>make uninstall
>exit

You should delete the .gtans directory in each user's home directory.
The NLS catalogs are not removed.


Uninstalling a previous version (0.1 or 1.0)
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

You should do this BEFORE installing the new version and ONLY IF:
-An old version is installed :-)
-It was installed from sources (if you installed it from a RPM or
 DEB package use your package manager).
-You didn't change the makefile (in wich case you have to remember
 where you decided to put the files).

>su
>make uninstallold
>exit

In fact this simply deletes the following files and directories:
/usr/local/bin/gtans
/usr/local/lib/gtans/*

You should manually remove the config.gtans file in the users home
directory
